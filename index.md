## About:

  DISCLAIMER: This Resourcepack is made only for fun!
  
This resourcepack adds Ukranian dialect for Russian language. And also has some funny additions.

For example,

It turns this (Свекольный суп):

<img src="images/beetrootsoup.jpg">
  
 Into this (Борщ):
 
<img src="images/borsch.jpg">
  
This made because of Russian-speak Ukrainians prefer saying "Borsh" instead of "Beetrootsoup".

It's also changes "Свёкла" into "Буряк".
